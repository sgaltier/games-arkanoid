# Release notes

Changes to **Neon Break**, newest first. `#N` references point at the numbered findings in
[code-review.md](code-review.md).

The project is not versioned or tagged, so entries are grouped by the commit that delivered them.

## 2026-08-12 — Pause behaviour and keyboard access (`3ab988f`)

### Fixed

**Power-up timers no longer drain while the game is paused** (#4)
A 10-second "widen" used to keep counting down on the pause screen, so pausing to answer the door
could cost you the whole bonus. Effects now carry a `remaining` duration measured in seconds of
actual play instead of an absolute wall-clock deadline. As a side benefit the timers are now immune
to background-tab throttling and system clock adjustments.

**The game pauses itself when you switch away** (#5)
Backgrounding the tab or clicking into another window previously left the ball live. Returning
dropped you straight into the action with no warm-up, and power-up timers kept expiring in the
meantime. Both now trigger an automatic pause. It only fires on leaving — coming back never
auto-resumes, so you restart play deliberately.

**Space activates a focused button instead of being swallowed** (#6)
Space was unconditionally suppressed to stop the page scrolling, which also meant a keyboard-only
player who tabbed to "Rejouer" could not press it with Space (Enter still worked). Space is now
handed back to the browser whenever a button holds focus.

This carried a companion fix worth knowing about: the pause and mute buttons on the deck stay
on-screen and keep focus after a mouse click, so the change alone would have made Space toggle pause
instead of launching the ball. Those buttons now drop focus after pointer clicks only — keyboard
activation keeps focus, so tab-order navigation is unaffected.

### Notes

Verified with a throwaway headless harness that stubs the DOM, loads the real script, and drives the
game loop directly — 18 assertions covering timer suspension across a 30-second pause, both
auto-pause triggers, and the Space/focus interaction. The harness was not committed.

## 2026-08-12 — Document structure and crash-safety (`18130c8`)

### Fixed

**Accented French text can no longer mojibake** (#1)
The file began directly at `<style>` with no doctype and no charset declaration. Opened over
`file://`, or served without a `charset` header, browsers fell back to windows-1252 and rendered
`Détruisez` as `DÃ©truisez`. The page now has a proper `<!doctype html>`, `<html lang="fr">`, and a
`<head>` carrying `<meta charset="utf-8">`, a viewport meta, and a `<title>`.

This also moves the page out of quirks mode into standards mode.

**A blocked `localStorage` no longer kills the game** (#2)
The best score was read at startup while building the game state. In Safari private browsing, with
site data disabled, or in some sandboxed `file://` contexts, touching `localStorage` *throws* — which
aborted the entire script and left a dead black canvas with no error the player could see. Reads and
writes are now guarded, falling back to an in-memory best score.

**The paddle no longer sticks to a wall after alt-tabbing** (#3)
No `keyup` is delivered for a key still held when the window loses focus, so alt-tabbing mid-press
left the paddle pinned against the edge until you pressed and released that key again. Held keys are
now cleared on blur.

## 2026-08-12 — Code review (`d20ab63`)

Added [docs/code-review.md](code-review.md): 32 numbered findings across correctness, performance,
code structure, accessibility, and gameplay, each anchored to the relevant source lines with an
effort estimate. No code changes.
