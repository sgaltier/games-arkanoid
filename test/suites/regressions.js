  One test per fixed finding from docs/code-review.md.

  This is the file that grows every time a bug is fixed. The convention is in
  docs/testing.md: write the test, watch it fail against the unfixed code, then
  fix the bug and watch it pass. A regression test that has never been seen
  failing proves nothing.

  Tests elsewhere in the suite may cover the same ground more thoroughly; the
  point of this file is to state, in one place and in the finding's own terms,
  what must never come back.
